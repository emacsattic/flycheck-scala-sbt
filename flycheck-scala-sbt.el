;;; flycheck-scala-sbt.el --- sbt-mode checker for Scala -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Version: 0.1
;; Url: https://www.github.com/rjmac/flycheck-scala-sbt
;; Package-requires: ((emacs "25.1") (flycheck "30") (sbt-mode "0.2"))

;;; Commentary:

;; Provides an sbt-mode based checker for scala files.  Call

existing buffer in the same project, as that other buffer will
not be rechecked unless it is either saved or `flycheck-buffer'
is explicitly called.  This configuration option causes
flychecking a Scala buffer automatically initiate checks in all
other buffers that share the same session.  SBT will only
actually compile once, but the errors will be distributed to all
relevant buffers.

This option is somewhat experimental."
